# API Documentation

- Use OpenAPI documentation for all public APIs.
- Having OpenAPI documentation for internal APIs is preferable.
- Test implementation against API sepcification using OpenAPI validators such as `league/openapi-psr7-validator`. This helps ensure our documentation doesn't get left behind when changes are made.
