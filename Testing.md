# Testing

- Use PHPUnit
- No hard rules on coverage but using it can help with removing unused code, etc.
- Write Unit Tests for Repositories using database assertions.
- Mock Repositories in Feature tests.
- Feature tests for all API endpoints and Module API Interface methods.
- Write as much unit tests as you can!
- If a middleware is disabled in Feature tests make sure to unit test it.
- Test relationship retrun types.
